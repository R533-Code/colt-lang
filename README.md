## Colt:
A programming language in its early stages of development.

## Features:
For the twelfth time, a whole codebase rewrite is in progress. A lot more efforts have been poured into the design of the language and the compiler to avoid another codebase rewrite.

Most utilities (such as data structures and unicode helpers) have been factored out of the compiler and moved to the [Colt-Cpp](https://github.com/R533-Code/colt-cpp) repository.

Also in this rewrite, the design of the compiler follows a more data-oriented approach, as seen in [Chandler Carruth's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI198eFghJk).
